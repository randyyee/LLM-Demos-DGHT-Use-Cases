    "### Demo #7 Using Multiagent Frameworks for Situation Reports (SITREP)\n",
    "Use a multiagent framework to create a routine newsletter or situation report (SITREP). The idea is that you can take all the bits and pieces from the previous demos and deploy an army of agents to gather internal/external data, analyze data, and synthesize findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several frameworks you can utilize to do this like crewai (see Demo #6) and Autogen (https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/). In this demo, we'll be using Autogen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, datasets used by the agents are summarized datasets from the MER Structured Dataset (MSD). I summarize the dataset beforehand to reduce the instructions (and possibly errors) I need to give to the agent. "

      "1. **Angola**\n",
      "    - The 'TB_PREV' indicator in 'Benguela', 'Cunene', 'Lunda Sul', '_Military Angola' psnus for all age groups shows achievement below 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Botswana**\n",
      "    - The 'TB_PREV' indicator in psnus like 'Bobirwa District', 'Boteti District', amongst others and for all age groups, shows achievement below 50%.\n",
      "    - The 'AGYW_PREV' indicator with various psnus like 'Kgatleng District', 'Kweneng East District', etc. shows achievement below 50% for the age groups 10-14, 20-24.\n",
      "    - The 'OVC_SERV' indicator shows an achievement of 0% across most geographies and age groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Burundi**\n",
      "    - The 'TB_PREV' indicator across almost all psnus shows an achievement below 50% for no specified age group.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cameroon**\n",
      "    - All districts and age groups have shown an achievement of below 50% in regards to the 'TB_PREV' and 'KP_PREV' indicators.\n",
      "    - The 'OVC_SERV' indicator has shown 0% achievement for the age groups under 1 and under 14 across specific psnus. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Democratic Republic of the Congo**\n",
      "    - The 'OVC_SERV' indicator is 0% for [<01, 01-04, 05-09, 10-14, 15-17, 18+] age groups across all PSNUs.\n",
      "    - For 'TB_PREV', most psnus show an achievement below 50% for all age groups.\n",

      "6. **Kenya**\n",

      "This summary highlights the lack of achievement in certain geographic and population segments across different operating units. Significant improvements are needed in ages and regions experiencing below 50% achievement. The 'VMMC_CIRC' and 'TB_PREV' indicators require special attention as they consistently fall below expected targets in multiple regions. Going forward, efforts should be concentrated in these areas to ensure comprehensive healthcare coverage and disease prevention. \n",

      "\n",
      "- TB_PREV achievement in Benguela, Cunene, Lunda Sul, and Military Angola regions in Angola.\n",
      "- TB_PREV achievement across districts in Botswana.\n",
      "- TB_PREV achievement across PSNUs in Burundi.\n",
      "- TB_PREV and KP_PREV achievement across districts and age groups in Cameroon.\n",
      "- All indicators (OVC_SERV, TB_PREV, TB_STAT and VMMC_CIRC) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n",
      "- VMMC_CIRC and TB_PREV indicators in all PSNUs for Kenya. \n",
